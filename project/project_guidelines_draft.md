# BIOS 512: Final Project Guidelines

[**This is a DRAFT of the final project guidelines.**]{style="color: red;"} For this project, you will take a data set (or sets) of your choosing and perform an analysis on it using techniques we talked about in class. This project is due **Tuesday, December 9, 2025 by 3PM**.

## Expectations

You will turn in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) to your GitHub repository.

This file should have:

-   The an explanation of your data source (or sources) and your research question (or questions).
-   An example of each of the following methods: dimensionality reduction, clustering, and regression/logistic regression. (ideally, but not necessarily on a single data set)
-   Results and interpretations.
    -   This should contain around four to five figures with titles and axis titles (if applicable).
-   Final conclusions of your analysis with ideas for future research.

## Requirements

-   Use a data set of your choice. It should be large enough to handle some interesting analysis but small enough to handle locally.
-   Include around 4-5 well-labeled plots or tables with a short explanation.
-   Your code must be clean and readable. Make small commits with good commit messages.

## Submission

Commit your `.ipynb` file to your course GitHub repository, with a `README` that describes where to get the data (unless its small enough to fit in the repo itself). Submit the link to your GitHub repository to Canvas. All commits must be submitted before 12/9 at 3PM.

## Grading Breakdown

| Category | Description | Points |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Code** | Clear, reproducible, and correct. | 30 |
| **Figures** | Approximately 4 well-labeled, informative figures or tables. | 30 |
| **Explanations and Interpretation** | Clear written explanation of your methods, reasoning, and interpretation of results. | 25 |
| **Conclusions** | Insightful summary of findings, limitations, and potential next steps. | 15 |

## Setup

As we've done with homework, you need to have your Git repo set up correctly, and working with Binder.\
\
**Make sure you have done the following**:

-   Installed Git.
-   Created your git repo.
-   Generated your SSH key so that you can push things from your local computer to GitHub.
-   Configured Binder so that your work can be easily reproduced.

## Where To Find Data

There are a lot of places online that have open source data. Here are a few ideas with embedded links:

-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - User-contributed data
-   [data.gov](https://data.gov/) - U.S. government data
-   [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) - Classic data sets used in ML research
-   [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets) - Free public data
