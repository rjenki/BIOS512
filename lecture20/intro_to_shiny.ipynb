Great for your portfolio.\n2. Really good for the interactive stage of your project.\n3. Really compelling. Perhaps too compelling!\n\nDon't let your research get TED-talkified. An interactive visualization should eventually yield to some concrete hypothesis evaluated rigorously. \n\nGood visualization takes the thing you're interested in showing people and makes it **pre-attentively processed**, meaning that whatever information's in the visualization is encoded in such a way that your brain can understand the structure of the visualization without having to think.\n\n## Overview of the Web\nShiny is a library for R which allows us to build interactive, data-oriented applications that run in a web browser.  \n\nThe intent is to allow you to exploit the interactivity of the web browser without learning the associated technologies (HTTP(S), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.).  \n\nThis is a laudable goal, but some background in these extremely useful and absolutely pervasive technologies is good for any technical person to have.  \n\n### How the Web Works\nYour browser is a client which talks to servers. In the simplest case, a server is just something waiting on an IP address (and a port) for a client to initiate a connection so that it can respond.  \n\nSomething called a domain name server maps names to IP addresses. There are a few special cases:\n1. localhost is a \"domain\" which always maps to the local computer (typically 127.0.0.1).\n0.0.0.0 means \"any interface\" on the local machine.\n2. 127.0.0.1 also represents \"this machine\".\n  \nMost traffic going through your browser uses a protocol called HTTP. HTTPS is the secure version of this protocol-the details of which we will gloss over. More or less from our point of view the two are identical.\n\n### HTTP Requests\nYou can think of an HTTP request as a single document (the details of its representation aren't very important). It does have some stereotypical parts, however:  \n\n1. HEADER - contains information about the request type, the resource requested, parameters\n2. BODY - may contain anything. Think of it as some text information\n\nThe header often contains information for the server about the way to intepret the body - it may say that the body is to be understoof as JSON or a CSV for some other format. \n\nThere are a few request types worth knowing:\n1. GET - a request for a resource. Typically doesn't contain a body since it represents a simple request for something.\n2. POST - a request to update a resource on the server. POSTs are used for a lot of things, but a lice way to think of POST is \"as in POST a Tweet.\" You update your timeline (the resource) with the tweet (some new data).\n3. PUT - A request to replace a resource entirely with the contents of the request. A PUT would be the appropriate message type if you were to replace your profile image on Twitter. You aren't amending your photo. You are replacing it.\n4. DELETE - a request to delete the resource.\n  \nTo a large degree these things are conventional. For instance, you might update your profile on Twitter with a POST request for the resource representing your profile.  \n  \nNB - cookies are little things that a client and server pass back and forth in the HEADER to represent so-called \"session\" information.  \n\n### Debugging with your Browser\nAgain, ideally you won't need to do this, but I wanted to show you how.  \nOn Mac, `Cmd+Option+I`, and Windows/Linux, `F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I`, to get to this screen on your browser.   \n![](debug.png)\n\n### HTML/CSS\nHTML is a text based language for describing documents. CSS is the associated language for describing how those documents should be rendered. HTML looks like this:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Example</title>\n    </head>\n        <body>\n        <img src=\"\"/>\n        <p>Hello World</p>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNote that every opening tag (e.g., \"\\<p>\") is matched by a closing tag (e.g., \"\\</p>\"). Some tags don't need this treatment if they don't enclose anything. In that case you see the \"/\" at the end of the tag as in the image example above. This is a self-closing tag. You should read such tags as both the open and close tag. E.g.:\n\n```html\n<p/>\n```\n\nis the same as:\n```html\n<p></p>\n```\n\nBrowsers are pretty forgiving if you forget to close a tag, but who knows what you'll see if you forget. It's wrong to not close tags. In fact, for the appendices in the clustering lecture I had some serious problems pulling data from a web page because there were unclosed tags.  \n  \nNote shat the Mil above just conveys semantic information with its tags.  \n  \nIt's up to the browser to use CSS (cascading style sheets) tells the biowser how to actually \"render\" the page.  \n  \nIt looks like this:\n```html\np {\n  background-color: red; \n  font-size: 15px;\n}\n```\n\nYou link CSS to a document via a line in the element:\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n```","metadata":{}},{"id":"2ac25a72-9269-41f0-b5cd-952681e5abde","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### JavaScript!\nLike HTML and CSS, Shiny purports to hide this from you. JavaScript is the programming language running inside your browser. It handles non-trivial behaviors that happen on the client.  \n  \nJavaScript is, very broadly speaking, similar to R.  \n  \nKey differences:\n1. Much less environment tomfoolery. You cannot get your hands on environments.\n2. Eager evaluation is the only model: arguments to functions are evaluated before the function body is entered and cannot be evaluated anywhere else but the calling context.\n3. Ubiquity of \"objects.\" JavaScript heavily uses objects which are similar to R lists but meant only for key/value associations. There are also JavaScript arrays, but these can hold any type of object and are only one dimensional.\n4. Asynchronous execution model. The primary role of JavaScript code is to do something and then get out of the way so the browser can take over. Thus, you frequently write \"callbacks\" or some variation on them (promises or use of the async/await pattern) to tell the browser you want to run a piece of code|when some specific event happens.\nWe don't actually need to program in javascript to use Shiny but this isn't a bad time to show you just how similar it is to R:\n\n```java\nconsole. log (\"Hello World\" )\n    \nif(10 < 11){\n    console. log (\"Output\");\n} else {\n    console. log \"Not output\");\n}\n\nfunction someFunctionReturnsNothing (a,b){\n    console. log(a + b)\n}\n\nfunction someFunctionReturnsSomethign (a,b){\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nconst x = []:\n    \nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++){\n    console. log (i);\n    x[i] = i+1\n}\n\nx. forEach(function (x) { console.log(x) });\n```","metadata":{}},{"id":"3006bbc6-a499-4a38-951d-a659fbd6f6ac","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Shiny Basics\nBecause browsers are so ubiquitous and powerful they are a great platform for visualization engines.  \n  \nHowever, the above combination of technologies is a lot to onboard if you don't want to dedicate significant amount of time to it.  \n  \nThus: Shiny.

If those \"dependencies\" become out of date, then they know that their own return value has also become out of date. Because of this dependency tracking, changing a reactive value will automatically instruct all reactive expressions that directly or indirectly depend on that value to re-execute.\"\n  \nNote that this is a bit like a Makefile, except for values in R.\n  \nOne of the most important ideas here is that a function is sort of like a promise to give a value at some later date. That is why all the reactive variables we create in a Shiny app are used like functions.  \n  \nHere is an example from the documentation:  \n(Note that this example makes use of the rock, pressure and cars datasets).  \n\n```R\ndatasetInput <- reactive({ \n    switch(input$dataset,\n        \"rock\" = rock,\n        \"pressure\" = pressure,\n        \"cars\" = cars)\n})\n```\n\nWe have some of the tools to parse this expression already. First of all, it seems like this reactive value refers to an input object which has no binding.\nReactive expressions must thus do something funny with the evaluation semantics of the language.\nIndeed, if we try to execute this expression in R:\n\n```R\ndatasetInput()\ndatasetInput()\nError in .getReactiveEnvironment()$ currentContext() : Operation not allowed without an active reactive context.\n(You tried to do something that can only be done from inside a reactive expression or observer.)\n```\nHowever, if we call datasetInput from inside of our server function it will run. Reactive expressions need to be in the right context to mean something. Most of the time that context is the UI declaration or the server function.","metadata":{}},{"id":"6726782f-dd42-4b85-adda-41df5cc3cec6","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sources, Conductors, and Endpoints\nConsider this example: \n```R file=fib-example.R\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n    numericInput(inputId = \"n\", value = 1, label = \"n\"),\n    textOutput(outputId = \"nthValue\"),\n    textOutput(outputId = \"nthValueInv\")\n)\n\nfib <- function(n) ifelse(n < 3, 1, fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n\n    currentFib <- reactive({ fib(as.numeric(input$n)) })\n    \n    output$nthValue    <- renderText({ currentFib() })\n    output$nthValueInv <- renderText({ 1 / currentFib() })\n}\n\n# Start the Server\nshinyApp(\n    ui = ui,\n    server = server,\n    options = list(port = 8888, host = \"0.0.0.0\")\n)\n```\n\nLike the last example, type `Rscript fib-example.R` into the terminal, then go to http://localhost:8888/ to see the graphic.\n\n![](shiny.png)\n\n[Reactivity Overview](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/reactivity-overview/)\nA useful metaphor for reactive objects is that they are cells in a big virtual spreadsheet linked by formulas. When you change a cell that a formula depends on, the formula is re-run. You can simplify a calculation in a spreadsheet by putting values into intermediate cells. These are the reactive conductors.  \n\nWe can label all the parts of our app now. The inputs are sources, the outputs are endpoints and the currentFib object represents a conductor. It happens to cache our data.  \n\nNote that we put all the reactive code inside the server function.\n\n### reactiveVal\nIn addition to reactive expressions, Shiny provides \"reactive values\" that act like variables managed by the reactive system. The simplest form is reactiveVal, which creates a single-value container with function semantics:\n\n```R\nsel_ids <- reactiveVal (integer(0))\n\n# Read the value (getter)\ncurrent <- sel_ids()\n\n# Update the value (setter)\nsel_ids(unique(c(current, 42)))\n\n# Use inside observers/reactives to trigger updates when it changes\nobserve({\n    ids <- sel_ids()\n    # do something whenever ids changes\n})\n```\n\n`reactiveVal` objects are functions: calling with no arguments reads the value; calling with one argument sets the value and invalidates any dependents.","metadata":{}},{"id":"112e801c-8264-4c15-9c2c-84df78d93b9f","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Plots, Inputs, Examples\n### Shiny, ggplot and plotly.\nWe can use ggplot directly inside of Shiny:\n```R\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  numericInput(inputId = \"n\",\n               value = 1,\n               label = \"Samples\"),\n  plotOutput(outputId = \"thePlot\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  output$thePlot <- renderPlot(\n    ggplot(tibble(x = rnorm(as.numeric(input$n))), aes(x)) +\n      geom_histogram()\n  )\n}\n\n# Start the Server\nshinyApp(\n  ui = ui,\n  server = server,\n  options = list(port = 8081, host = \"0.0.0.0\")\n)\n```\nTo run this, `Rscript ggplot-example.R` in the terminal, and go to http://localhost:8081/.  \n  \nBut doing so isn't satisfactory.
