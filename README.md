### Binder Set Up
Using the instructions from https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html, I set up Binder for this Git repository using the R instructions.  
*I did have to add options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.r-project.org")) to the first line of my install.R file.
